# UAV-BCD
UAV-BCD:The  proposed dataset contains 2024 pairs of finely registered  high-resolution images collected by UAVs and their  corresponding pixel-level labels, which can provide a new  benchmark for RSCD. We evaluate the effectiveness of  UAV-BCD with the five state-of-art deep neural networks in  RSCD.
