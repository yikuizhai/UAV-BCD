# UAV-BCD
UAV-BCD:The proposed dataset contains 2024 pairs of finely registered high-resolution images collected by UAVs and their corresponding pixel-level labels, which can provide a new  benchmark for RSCD. We evaluate the effectiveness of UAV-BCD with the five state-of-art deep neural networks in RSCD.The UA-BCD dataset can be downloaded via the following Baidu.com linkï¼šhttps://pan.baidu.com/s/1tJVFkJU4fmX_nGqi70b3yA?pwd=32qc
